UTS namespaces (CLONE_NEWUTS, Linux 2.6.19) isolate two system identifiers—nodename and domainname—returned by the uname() system call; the names are set using the sethostname() and setdomainname() system calls. In the context of containers, the UTS namespaces feature allows each container to have its own hostname and NIS domain name. This can be useful for initialization and configuration scripts that tailor their actions based on these names. The term "UTS" derives from the name of the structure passed to the uname() system call: struct utsname. The name of that structure in turn derives from "UNIX Time-sharing System".
