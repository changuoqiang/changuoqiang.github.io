Dumps created by pg_dump are internally consistent, meaning, the dump represents a snapshot of
the database at the time pg_dump began running. pg_dump does not block other operations on the
database while it is working. (Exceptions are those operations that need to operate with an exclusive
lock, such as most forms of ALTER TABLE .)
